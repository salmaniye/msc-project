1.36545E+18,@zzshibe I personally don't like the art style of the remakes but the main reason I am probably not going to buy it is because it seems to be a remake where not much is changed unlike previous pokemon remakes like ORAS or HGSS.

1.36542E+18,@pokestir I'm actually looking forward to the remakes and Legends Arceus but Legends Arceus looks really dope. I didn't like the Sinnoh remakes at first but it kinda grew on me and I'm totally fine with it even if the overworld models are ass,2021-02-26 21:53:03+00:00

1.36542E+18,"@StealthRare Legends Arceus looks cool, it also looks like that could be where all the funding went considering how trashy diamond and pearls overworld looks. Still, after how bad Sword and Shield were I have very low expectations for Legends Arceus.",2021-02-26 21:52:56+00:00

1.36542E+18,"DP remakes probably look more “faithful” not just because it’s cheaper, but to avoid similarity.

If DP used SwSh’s engine/style, while also making Pokemon Legends Arceus, there’d be a much bigger shitstorm that “they both look the same”... and they’d be right.",2021-02-26 21:52:30+00:00
1.36542E+18,"I'm off work and finally can get my pokemon takes in:

I'm so pleased with the direction they're taking for gen 4 remakes. 2d pokemon is best pokemon and anything returning partially to that has me hype

and omg, legends:arceus. looks so cool!!! No brakes on this hype train 🥵🥵",2021-02-26 21:52:30+00:00
1.36542E+18,"I was worried DP remakes would look like Let's Go or Gen 6 with a chibi style and I can't believe they managed to make it look worse than that

Well, the environments look neat but unless something wild happens this is gonna be a pass

But Legends Arceus? That looks really cool",2021-02-26 21:52:16+00:00

1.36541E+18,Pokemon Diamond/Pearl remakes look nice. Interesting direction with it. Pokemon Legends Arceus is dope looking too!,2021-02-26 21:21:25+00:00
1.36541E+18,"@GrimoireIndex To be fair
Same fan who are whoooing them for Pokemon Legends Arceus so, the SwSh might be more gf then fans",2021-02-26 21:21:16+00:00
1.36541E+18,"Today is a good day to be a Pokémon fan. Pokémon Snap info, the reveal of Brilliant Diamond and Shining Pearl, and also the reveal of Pokémon Legends: Arceus. We have been fed well today. Now, my next question: will SEGA surprise us with some Sonic news drops in March?",2021-02-26 21:21:12+00:00
1.36541E+18,The fact that it’s called Pokemon Legends: Arceus and not just Pokemon Legends implies that they might make more games like it.,2021-02-26 21:21:03+00:00
1.36541E+18,@pokestir This is my mentality as well. At least we have Legends: Arceus,2021-02-26 21:21:01+00:00
1.36541E+18,"Frankly, Pokemon Legends Arceus looks real close to what I dreamed Pokemon would become.",2021-02-26 21:20:54+00:00

1.36541E+18,ok so sinnoh remake looks weird and pokemon legends arceus looks a bit promising but im not getting my hopes up since lately gamefreak has been feeding everyone turds on a silver spoon and everyones just been eating up like they have no choice so. nah,2021-02-26 21:20:41+00:00
1.36541E+18,also pokemon legends arceus really pandering to me with my favorite starters,2021-02-26 21:20:36+00:00
1.36541E+18,The fact that it’s “Pokémon Legends: Arceus” makes me think they might do more in the future and that sounds dope,2021-02-26 21:20:35+00:00

1.36541E+18,"@JohnnyZaccari Man, Pokémon Legends looks amazing, but i’m kinda worried how it will affect new gens in the future. It’s called Pokemon Legends: Arceus, and paying attention to “: Arceus” means it will probably be it’s own series. Will gen 9 just be Pokemon Legends or this open world...",2021-02-26 21:19:48+00:00

1.36541E+18,"as much as i want to see #PokemonLegendsArceus succeed, the impression the trailer left me was that it is an empty lifeless shell of a world. #pokemon ai will have to have agency and realistic reactions to the world they occupy for this to work, not aimlessly roaming around",2021-02-26 21:19:13+00:00

1.3654E+18,im interested in that pokemon legends arceus game. the gameplay style doesn’t look TOO different compared to past games based on what they’ve shown but it’s good they’re taking the story for a genuine pokemon entry outside of “There are a lot of Gyms.

1.3654E+18,"@KPX_ErdeKaiser @McTroid @ExpandDong15 Agreed, Gamefreak is just in too good position currently. They basicly doesn't need to do than bare minumum and games will sell anyway. It's not like I hate Legends Arceus, I just wish they would do it better than what current trailer showed. 1 year is short time develope a game",2021-02-26 20:42:11+00:00

1.3654E+18,@Paulrobertryan Considering we’ll get other pokemon legends arceus type games in the future I reckon they’ll make a game like Pokemon legends zygarde and actually give zygarde the story it never had in XY or Pokemon Z,2021-02-26 20:41:51+00:00

1.3654E+18,@zwoolk @NintendoAmerica Maybe that'll give equal love to those starters and also make what the starters are based on having a larger role and fit the theme.

1.3654E+18,It's also possible this is trending because people think Pokemon Legends Arceus looks like BotW because...it's open world and...there are open plains with few settlements? Hate to break it to you mouthbreathers as well  but BotW didn't invent wilderness.,2021-02-26 20:41:08+00:00

1.36534E+18,The pokemon legends arceus game looks like a lot of fun. Also Oshawott being a starter gotta get him. I wonder if you can soft reset for a shiny starter if so i'm doing that.,2021-02-26 16:18:29+00:00
1.36534E+18,i hope pokemon legends arceus has a lot of story in it for being an open world game i wanna know everything about sinnoh also the fact there’s mixed starters is gonna add so much to on going timeline theories im so AAAA,2021-02-26 16:18:28+00:00
1.36534E+18,"Legends Arceus looks like what I expected SWSH to be though, and with a setting I like better, so that's cool as heck

1.36534E+18,lowkey it kinda feels like DP remakes are a throwaway project that tho i personally prefer a lot bout (mainly the choice of goin w/ the chibi sprite kinda style) still looks rly off nd ugly in a lot of places whereas legends arceus is more of a platinum-in-spirit kinda deal,2021-02-26 16:18:24+00:00

1.36534E+18,"So, with BDSP not being made by GF, and the different visual style, I bet it will not be directly connectable to SwSh, making this idea of ""generations"" a little blurred

1.36534E+18,"@LunarosEffect I was hoping for a more modern artstyle though, it lools like the color is dulled in a lot of places too. It looks less like a remake and more like a remaster. I'd say pokemon legends arceus is more of a remake",2021-02-26 16:18:17+00:00
1.36534E+18,"Even if you don't like the look of the Sinnoh Remakes, it's the right move. It's less ambitious &amp; more faithful so they can reliably outsource it.

1.36533E+18,I wonder if Ransei will play any relevance in #PokemonLegendsArceus since 1) it's also in a feudal setting and 2) Arceus also played a significant role in Pokémon Conquest's lore... 🤔🤔🤔 https://t.co/pCP1ojRfeU,2021-02-26 16:07:34+00:00
1.36533E+18,"Excited to see what that Pokemon Legends Arceus thing is like, looks interesting, but i wanna see more gameplay before i get my hopes up. 

Not going to even touch the Sinnoh remakes though, unless they've vastly improved the game in some way.",2021-02-26 16:07:29+00:00
1.36533E+18,"I guess another worry about Legends Arceus is the amount of options of Pokemon, i feel like a game of that magnitude has to cut corners somewhere, like it might only have like 80-100 pokemon.",2021-02-26 16:07:27+00:00
1.36533E+18,"@IntroSpecktive I am just afraid the world in Legends Arceus will be bare bones, leading to have no reason to actually explore and catch new pokemon.",2021-02-26 16:07:27+00:00
1.36533E+18,"So like obviously for Pokémon legends arceus, you pick Cyndaquill because he’s the best of the three. But who do you pick for Diamond and Pearl? (Obviously not chimchar)",2021-02-26 16:07:23+00:00
1.36533E+18,@DrizzyJeremiah DP was expected but exciting to see. Pokémon Legends Arceus is literally the concept of Pokémon Generations. The fanmade Pokémon game we played together like 7 years ago https://t.co/cQ6JgFM5L7,2021-02-26 16:07:18+00:00
1.36533E+18,I am interested in Legends Arceus. Making a lot of changes that are pulling me in. Will follow the development more definitely. BD/SP aren't really my thing personally. But I'll see how they turn out.,2021-02-26 16:07:18+00:00
1.36533E+18,"@JU1CYP1NEAPPLE I kinda like them. To me, it's a return to form. There doesn't appear to be any gimmicks from the later games, so no Mega Evolution, Z Moves, or Dynamax. Until further inspection, this and Legends Arceus feel like they were made with the older fans in mind",2021-02-26 16:07:17+00:00

1.36533E+18,"@PLDHnet Honestly, this game feels like it is for new fans that haven’t played the original. They want people to experience the Diamond and Pearl games so they can compare it better to Legends: Arceus",2021-02-26 16:05:28+00:00
1.36533E+18,They even had the guts to put Cyndaquil as one of the mixed starters for Legends Arceus. This is just tailored for me.,2021-02-26 16:05:28+00:00

1.36533E+18,"@farhan_games It’s fine. There was Pokémon Legends Arceus, &amp; I’m surprisingly excited for it since it looks like Game Freak is finally gonna make an open-world Pokémon. And that’s something I’ve wanted for years ever since I played Breath of the Wild. So yeah, I’m super interested in Legends!",2021-02-26 16:05:27+00:00
1.36533E+18,I'm curious with Pokemon Legends: Arceus~ I hope we can get info about that title but by the looks for it's not a mainline games~,2021-02-26 16:05:26+00:00

1.36533E+18,"Zelda: BotW's exploration &amp; vast world is amazing, but I felt that its missing something for me.

1.36533E+18,"Hey, #PokemonLegendsArceus looks interesting. If we’re all still alive in 2022 maybe we can see if it lives up to being Breath of the Wild with Pokémon. I’m not sure that’s the promise, but seems similar.",2021-02-26 16:05:24+00:00
1.36533E+18,@Legends_Arceus @NinSwitchIntel Why should I choose. They are all my buds,2021-02-26 16:05:23+00:00
1.36533E+18,"So overall thoughts, beginning was not NEEDED but was at least nice to see, ate up too much time imo

Events cool

DP remakes look like shit, I know outsourced but if they ain't competitive I ain't getting, at least its VERY faithful

THEN LEGENDS ARCEUS LOOKS AMAZING",2021-02-26 16:05:20+00:00
1.36533E+18,"The legends Arceus game does not look convincing at all.

Being open world and looking like ""BotW"" does not mean it's automatically good lmao. 

Need to see a lot more.

1.36533E+18,@Nibellion I'm extremely grateful for this game that will appear in 2022!  I've always been curious about what a region has been like before humans roamed on it.  Pokemon Legends Arceus will answer that for me.,2021-02-26 16:05:12+00:00
1.36533E+18,Between new Pokemon Snap and Pokemon Legends Arceus I think i'm gonna be a pretty happy camper,2021-02-26 16:05:08+00:00

- Gen 4 remakes are doing their jobs as remakes well, it’s 1:1 but with 3D models. They look great

- Pokémon Legends Arceus is an amazing concept and I’m glad they’re running with the wild area

- Both need more time in the oven",2021-02-26 16:04:55+00:00

1.36533E+18,100% Excited for both Pokémon games. An external Dev for Sinnoh remakes so that Pokémon Legends Arceus could be made to be amazing is definitely the right move.

1.36533E+18,Am I the only one who feels that Pokémon Legends Arceus feels somewhat... empty? I feel the concept is awesome and the game is still far from done but I’m hoping there are more dynamics than a tiny town and fighting a few monsters in the grass.,2021-02-26 15:43:13+00:00
1.36533E+18,legends arceus looks GOOD even with their framerate choices so idc i will ignore any hate about legends arceus no matter how valid,2021-02-26 15:43:13+00:00

1.36533E+18,"Pokemon Brilliant Diamond and Shining Pearl look like very safe remakes, but since this is the first mainline game that's outsourced, I understand that choice.

1.36533E+18,I'm genuinely hyped for both the Sinnoh Remakes and Legends: Arceus. HOWEVER: I need some clarification as to whether Legends is replacing main series or if it's a separate venture.

1.36533E+18,It makes complete sense why Diamond/Pearl aren’t in the Sword/Shield style graphics like we expected. They have the Pokemon Home team working on that while Game Freak is working on Legends: Arceus. I think the Link’s Awakening style for Diamond/Pearl is fine. #PokemonPresents,2021-02-26 15:42:50+00:00

I'm kinda on the fence for D/P remake, but maybe it's better for Pokemon series to stick with stylized designs rather than a realistic one.
